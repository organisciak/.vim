VIM Dotfiles
============

This repo keeps my recommended vim settings and plugins.

Installation
------------

Clone Repo

```
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/organisciak/.vim.git
```

Vim settings are kept in ~/.vimrc. To keep everything in the repo, add a symlink to the repo's version of vimrc. This will replace your copy.

```
ln ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
